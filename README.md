# Docker Stack for AiiDAlab

This repo contains the Docker file used in the [AiiDAlab](https://www.materialscloud.org/aiidalab).

Docker images are available from Dockerhub via `docker pull aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack:latest`.
See [aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack) for a list of available tags.

# Deploy on AiiDAlab server

To deploy changes, log into the AiiDAlab server and execute the following commands:
```
docker pull aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack:latest
docker tag aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack:latest aiidalab-docker-stack:latest
```
The users will gradually pick up the new image, whenever they restart their container via the _Control Panel_.

# Deploy locally

Make sure that Docker is installed on your machine, otherwise go to [Docker installation page](http://www.docker.com/install)
and follow the instructions for your operating system.

Then, start AiiDAlab:
```
./run.sh PORT PATH_TO_AIIDALAB_HOME_DIR
```

Where `PORT` is any free port on your machine (typically it is 8888) and `PATH_TO_AIIDALAB_HOME_DIR` is an absolute path to the folder where user's data will be stored
(typically it is something like `${HOME}/aiidalab`).
The last line of the output of the command above will contain the link to access AiiDAlab in your browser.

# Update requirements.txt

First make sure you have python 3.7 available in your system.
If that is the case, then adjust the [`Pipfile`](Pipfile) according to the latest releases.
Then do:
```
pip install pipenv # If it is already installed, make sure it is the latest version.
pipenv lock --python 3.7 --requirements > requirements.txt
```

Note: We try to keep the number of explicit dependencies in the `Pipfile` to a minimum.
Consider using [pipdeptree](https://pypi.org/project/pipdeptree/) to figure out the dependency tree and which dependencies are actually needed.


# Slow IO

To check for issues with OpenStack's block storage observe the following command for a **few minutes**:
```
watch -n 0.1 "ps axu| awk '{print \$8, \"   \", \$11}' | sort | head -n 10"
```
Pretty much all processes should be in the `S` state. If a process stays in the `D` state for a longer time it is most likely waiting for slow IO.
