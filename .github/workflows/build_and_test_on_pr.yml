# Test the Docker image on every pull request.
#
# The steps are:
# 1. Build docker image using cached data.
# 2. Start the docker container with local folder mounted to it.
# 3. Check that postgresql and rabbitmq are running.
# 4. Copy id_rsa file from the docker container to local folder.
# 5. Restart the container and check that the id_rsa file didn't change.
