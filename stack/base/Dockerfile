# Ensure that pip installs packages to '~/.local/lib/python3.X/site-packages/' by default
# by implicitly passing the '--user' option to 'pip install'
# Otherwise, pip would install into /opt/conda and such packages would be lost
# when the container exits.
# NOTE: We specifically chose the location '/opt/conda/pip.conf'
# which represents the 'site' config file when VIRTUAL_ENV is not set, per:
# https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/#configuration-files
# Other locations such as '~/.config/pip/pip.conf' or '/etc/pip.conf' would interfere with virtual environments,
# for example those used by pre-commit.
# We can't use the PIP_USER env variable for the same reason.
# To better understand this, try running `pip config debug` and see
